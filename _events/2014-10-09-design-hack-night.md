###About

Introducing Design Hack Night, an evening of conversation, making, and feedback. Inspired by the Tinderbox Hack Night, Design Hack Night is a chance to share your insights and learn from your peers.  Bring your projects, your laptop, sketchbooks, books - anything you’d like to share or work on. 

We’ll start the night with a series of lightning talks focusing on a variety of topics from a tool/technique, inspiration, a book, a product launch, a thought leader, the weather or more - anything you’ve discovered that impacts the craft of design.  No need to prepare any slides, but if you know you’d like to speak please email me at rob@atomidesign.com to guarantee a spot.

After lightning talks we’ll split into two groups - one will have open space to collaborate as a group (or solo if you so choose), while the other group will be a circle for giving feedback on work in progress.  While we’ll have some soft guidelines on providing feedback, constructive criticism is - as always - paramount to the success and improvement of any product.

Serving food and plenty of drinks as well!
