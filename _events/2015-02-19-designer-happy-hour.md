###About

We're having our fourth semi-monthly Designer Drinkup at the ever-classy Novela Bar in SoMa on February 19th. 

Get off the computer, drag a few coworkers, and come socialize with like-minded people in the industry after work over a drink or two!

###Sponsors

A huge thanks to Autodesk for sponsoring this Designer Drinkup! Shiya Luo from Autodesk will be attending to meet and talk with attendees, and will be providing a limited open bar on a first-come, first-serve basis to anyone in the group.
