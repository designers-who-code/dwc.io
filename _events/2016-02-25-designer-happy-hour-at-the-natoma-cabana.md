###About the Event

After much delay we're dusting things off for the new year and want to start with a happy hour at one of our favorite Soma bars, the Natoma Cabana. No hard work, no sitting through long talks, just good old-fashioned socializing with fellow designers and developers.

We've got our new logo printed on some spiffy heavyweight cardstock so you can find us easier than ever before, and will have everyone's favorite "Hello my name is..." stickers on-hand.

So get off your computer, drag a few coworkers, and come meet like-minded people in the industry over a drink or two!
