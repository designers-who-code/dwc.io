####Brandon Arnold  |  Day in the Life of Foundation for Apps 

Every year more and more is expected from Designers and every year designers pick up a new skill. The amount of code that is required of a designer is growing too and what used to be creating static html documents has now become creating slick webapp prototypes. Pages are gone and coding SPAs is a must, so how do we find the balance from static images to production code?

In this presentation we'll join Brandon Arnold, a design lead from ZURB, as he uses Notable to collects feedback from clients and incorporate that into his angular based prototype. Learn how to build with the Foundation for Apps grid system, create new views for you app without writing JS and incorporate some neat directives with slick animations. We'll even use sass to make some quick changes to our apps style variables and create a brand new custom theme for our app.

####Geoff Kimball | The New Frontier of Responsive Web App Patterns

Web Apps pose a new frontier for the responsive web and as similar as they can be to marketing sites, they require patterns of their own. We'll explore some of the patterns we've been using in Foundation for Apps by looking at what patterns didn't translate from Marketing Sites, building collapsing panels, reorienting and reordering menus, and how to design/build full width and full height layouts
