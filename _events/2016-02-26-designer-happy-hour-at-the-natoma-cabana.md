###About the Event

A happy belated 2016 to everyone! We've got several events in the works over the next few months, but figured we'd start things off by revisiting the Natoma Cabana for an after-work designer happy hour. If you haven't been before these events are casual get togethers to get everyone out of the office on time and meet other like-minded people in the industry.

We'll have a spiffy Designers Who Code sign so you can find us and will be sure to have "Hello my name is" stickers in your favorite colors on-hand.

So get off your computer, drag a few coworkers, and come meet socialize over a drink (or two)!
