[SF Creative Coders]() is having Drinks at [Kilowatt]() this Thursday to both celebrate the holidays and revival of their long-quiet group, and everyone from Designers Who Code is invited (and encouraged!) to come out.

Moving forward most of SF Creative Coders' events will be cross-posted here as their mission and intent closely parallels that of Designers Who Code, and anything that increases overall participation in our niche is a positive influence.

###How to Get There

Kilowatt is your staple "divey" bar in the Mission, easily accessible by BART or Muni. The 22 runs right outside, while 16th St Bart is 2 blocks away and Church St Station is 4 blocks away.

###Call for Speakers / Present Your Work

Have a topic to present or a work you'd like to show off? We're currently scheduling new events beginning in mid-to-late January and are looking for both speakers and attendees interested in showing off projects they're working on or recently completed. Events to tentatively be co-hosted by both DWC and SF Creative Coders, so you'll have a combined audience of nearly 4000 members to draw from!
