###About

Welcome to our 2nd Design Hack Night, an evening of conversation, making, and feedback.  Inspired by the  Tinderbox Hack Night, Design Hack Night is a chance to share your insights and learn from your peers.  Bring your projects, your laptop, sketchbooks, books — anything you’d like to share or work on!

We’ll start the night with a series of lightning talks focusing on a variety of topics from a tool/technique, inspiration, a book, a product launch, a thought leader, the weather or more — anything you’ve discovered that impacts the craft of design.  No need to prepare any slides, but if you know you’d like to speak please email me at rob@atomidesign.com to guarantee a spot.

After lightning talks those with projects will announce them to the audience and we’ll split into informal groups where you will have time receive feedback, collaborate on new ideas, or demo a work in progress. While we’ll have some soft guidelines on providing feedback, constructive criticism is - as always - critical to the success and improvement of any product.

Serving food and plenty of drinks as well!
