####Cy Hossain  |  The Unintentional Birth of a Startup 

Cy is self-taught designer/developer and CEO of Crowdcast.

####Shiya Luo  |  3D Design on the Web

Shiya is a developer evangelist at Autodesk. She is working on reaching out to web developers who have a passion about 2D/3D design. She will be talking about how Autodesk went around designing and building an API that lets you view 3D files directly on the Web.
